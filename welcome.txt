Welcome to the Rambling Cactus!

Safe and very simplistic place for your pointless, as well as, not so pointless banter. Sometimes we just need to let the steam out, Cactus is here to take it all. Just like in minecraft, the cactus is made for destroying stacks upon stacks. The spikes are spiky and nothing is safe. Just write for the sake of it. It might help.

You read the welcome note? Are u fr?

Anyways, I created this in one afternoon, you might very well be the only person using this. Congrats!
